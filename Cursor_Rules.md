ðŸ§¾ Cursor Project Rules
Make Minimal Changes
Only change what is explicitly asked. Avoid refactoring, renaming, or introducing new abstractions unless requested. Precision over initiative.

Write Clean, Readable Code
All code should be simple, well-structured, and easy to follow. Avoid cleverness that sacrifices clarity.

Comment Thoughtfully
Use comments to clarify why, not what. Explain non-obvious logic, assumptions, or edge cases. Keep comments concise and relevant.

Maintain a Clean Project Structure
Organize files logically. Keep directories lean. Avoid unnecessary nesting, unused files, or ambiguous file naming.

Preserve Consistency
Follow the existing coding style, naming conventions, and file structure unless directed otherwise.

Do Not Auto-Format or Lint Without Permission
Avoid applying automatic formatting or style fixes unless explicitly told to do so, even if a formatter is configured.

Ask for Clarification When in Doubt
If requirements are unclear, don't guess. Prompt for clarification instead of assuming intent.

Avoid Optimizing Prematurely
Prioritize readability and correctness over performance unless performance is the focus of the change.
